## The Trial App
The task description is very short, so I implemented it in my own way.

The necessary information I would have requested before starting work:
1. Description/schema of the XML/JSON files
2. Format of the expected JSON file.
3. information about a similar project in order to reuse the existing code 
    and make the project in accordance with the style of the existing project.
4. information about the sizes and the number of files that will have to be processed.

## Command line Arguments
app.jar --source-path ./test_data --dest-file ./test_data/output.json --image-path ./test_data/images
