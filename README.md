## The Trial App
The task description is very short and does not contain all the necessary information, 
so I implemented it in my own way.

If I had received this task at work, I would have requested detailed information about:
1. Description/schema of the XML/JSON files
2. Format of the expected JSON file.
3. information about a similar project in order to reuse the existing code 
    and make the project in accordance with the style of the existing project.
4. information about the sizes and the number of files that will have to be processed.

## Command line Arguments
app.jar --source-path ./test_data --dest-file ./test_data/output.json --image-path ./test_data/images
